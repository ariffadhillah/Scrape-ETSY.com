5,Rising Sun Jacket | Navy Blue Quilted 70s style Bomber Jacket | lightweight ski jacket as seen on @classicrockcouture,"29,580 sales","7,355 reviews",5 out of 5 stars,"Inspired by the Arizona desert sunset and 70s ski attire, this satin quilted bomber jacket is one of our biggest -- and first! -- feats yet in fashion design. In our years of hunting vintage, we have undyingly dreamed of finding a jacket like this on a thrift store rack or at an estate sale, with no avail. So we took matters into our own hands by crafting this gem from scratch, with all the most desirable qualities -- from the lightweight quilted texture all the way down to the 60s style metal YKK circle zipper.If you are looking for the bomber jacket Dex Parios (Cobie Smulders) is wearing in the ABC show “Stumptown,” then yes, tou have found it! This is THE original and authentic jacket featured on the show!We spent hours on end examining hundreds of color shades and combinations to come up with this perfect mix of navy blue, burnt orange, harvest gold, and champagne... with a magical pop of hot pink piping that we've dreamed about but never actually seen on a piece of clothing. The fit of this jacket is inspired by some of our favorite 70s vintage bomber, motorcycle and hunting jackets. We took our favorite elements of each to come up with this cropped style that's stylishly tailored yet offers enough comfort and movement to make this jacket perfect for everyday wear throughout the seasons. Pair it with shorts and a tank on a breezy summer night, or later over a sweater or hoodie in the winter.We guarantee there's nobody else out there selling a jacket like this, because we've been searching for years. For yourself and us both, we think this jacket is proof that dreams can come true.Measurements taken lying flat:Size XSArmpit to armpit: 18.5""Shoulder to shoulder: 13.25`""Arm length (from shoulder): 23""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 20.5""Bicep (half): 6.25”Waist: 14""Size SmallArmpit to armpit: 19""Shoulder to shoulder: 14.25""Arm length (from shoulder): 24.25""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 21.5""Bicep (half): 7”Waist: 14.75""Size MediumArmpit to armpit: 20""Shoulder to shoulder: 16""Arm length (from shoulder): 25.25""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 22.5""Bicep (half): 7.5”Waist: 16.5""Size LargeArmpit to armpit: 22.5""Shoulder to shoulder: 17.5""Arm length (from shoulder): 26""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 24.5""Bicep (half): 8”Waist: 19""Size XLArmpit to armpit: 23.75""Shoulder to shoulder: 19.75""Arm length (from shoulder): 27.75""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 28.25""Bicep: 8.75""Waist: 21.25""Size XXLArmpit to armpit: 24.5""Shoulder to shoulder: 20.5""Arm length (from shoulder): 28""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 28.75""Bicep: 9""Waist: 22""Size XXXLArmpit to armpit: 26.5""Shoulder to shoulder: 21.5""Arm length (from shoulder): 30""Shoulder to bottom hem (measured in front): 31.5""Bicep: 9.75""Waist: 22.5”","ad vertisement by ClassicRockCouture

It's your choice of fonts, colors, and location.  Choose a font from the last photo, and just tell me what thread color you prefer.  The vest shown has it monogrammed with Monogram KK.  You can choose to monogram it on the chest (like the picture), the upper back (the same size monogram as the picture), or the lower back (a very large monogram across the lower back of the vest)INITIALSPlease give me your full name, so there is no confusion over the monogram!  I will put the initials in order of first initial, LAST INITIAL LARGER, middle initial for you.  (aCb, but all capital letters).  SIZING:Generally a vest goes over a sweater or shirt, so keep that in mind!  These run  small.  If you have a long torso, or are on the fence, order the next size up!
